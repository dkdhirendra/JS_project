    <p><strong>Undefined :</strong><br>
               undefined is a global variable that JavaScript creates at run time. JavaScript assigns undefined to any variable that has been declared but not initialized or defined. In other words, in a case where no value has been explicitly assigned to the variable, JavaScript calls it undefined.</p>
  
    <P><strong>not defined :</strong><br>
              A not defined is a variable that is not declared at a given point of time with declaration keyword like var, let, or const.</P>
